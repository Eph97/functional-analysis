# MATH 320

This repository contains a collection of lecture notes for Yale's Functional Analysis class (MATH 325) for the Spring 2023 semester.

The notes pdf is not tracked but is updated periodically through releases. To compile locally, compile the notes.tex file. However I am using a custom formatting which must also be installed. Details on installing the custom style can be accessed [here](https://github.com/Eph97/coursework-latex)

<!-- A compiled pdf of the latest lecture notes can be downloaded through the "Compiled Notes" releases or by following this link to the [Compiled Notes](https://github.com/Eph97/Math320/releases/latest/download/notes.pdf) -->

I am a little behind writing up my notes but will catch up soon!
